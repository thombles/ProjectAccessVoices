Assign issues strategy

- One major policy
- A configurable number of minor policies
- Configurable number of points for both major and minor policies
- Your major policy is not someone else's major policy

function shuffle(array) {
  var currentIndex = array.length, temporaryValue, randomIndex ;

  // While there remain elements to shuffle...
  while (0 !== currentIndex) {

    // Pick a remaining element...
    randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * currentIndex);
    currentIndex -= 1;

    // And swap it with the current element.
    temporaryValue = array[currentIndex];
    array[currentIndex] = array[randomIndex];
    array[randomIndex] = temporaryValue;
  }

  return array;
}


(Treating issues by index)
- Shuffle the five selected issues in the game. i.e. shuffle an array containing numbers 0 to 4
- Assign the ones in positions as major issues for the player 0-3 
- 50/50 chance whether player is in favour of or against their major policy

Next we need to assign the minor issues
- Number to assign = players * number_of_minor_issues
So maybe this is 8 across 5 issues
Shuffle [0..4] in lots of 5 until you've made a list of index issues the right length
- Assign them to the players by looping through the players number_of_minor_issues times
During each assignment, look at all the previous minor assignments for that issue and count for and against
If for and against are not balanced, ensure you even it up

This means that minor issues will never be imbalanced by more than 1

Let's try to break this up into some smaller functions

assignIssues() - calls assignMajorIssues() and assignMinorIssues(). Each do the bits above.
